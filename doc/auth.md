## üìù Notes

### Current Status
All core authentication features have been implemented for the REC Proponent user role. The system includes:

- Complete Firebase authentication integration
- Multiple sign-in methods (Google, Microsoft, Email/Password)
- Email verification enforcement
- Dynamic navigation based on auth state
- **Smart route protection** (public `/rec/proponent`, protected `/dashboard/*` and `/application/*`)
- **Layout-based authentication guards** for protected routes only
- **Public route accessibility** for unauthenticated users
- Mobile-responsive design
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- **Smart navigation buttons** that handle authentication state

### Next Steps
1. Complete manual testing of all authentication flows
2. Create user documentation
3. Implement additional security measures if needed
4. Prepare for REC Chair and Reviewer role implementation

### Technical Debt
- Consider implementing refresh token handling for long-lived sessions
- Add more comprehensive error logging
- Consider implementing 2FA for enhanced security
- Add audit logging for authentication events
